## Synopsis

This project is an app following the tutorial from Ray Wenderlich, [*TrigBlaster*](https://www.raywenderlich.com/57368/trigonometry-game-programming-sprite-kit-version-part-1)
It is meant to guide the learner through using SpriteKit, touches on CoreMotion, and explains how to use trigonometry to get the job done!


## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
