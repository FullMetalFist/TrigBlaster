## Synopsis

This project is an app following the tutorial from Ray Wenderlich, [*TrigBlaster*](https://www.raywenderlich.com/57368/trigonometry-game-programming-sprite-kit-version-part-1)
It is meant to guide the learner through using SpriteKit, touches on CoreMotion, and explains how to use trigonometry to get the job done!

## Motivation

I am working on a game using SpriteKit, and felt this to be helpful.
